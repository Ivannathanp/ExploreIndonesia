              <p> Yogyakarta, together with its twin city Surakarta (Solo), is the cradle of civilization on Java. This city was the seat of power that produced the magnificent temples of Borobudur and Prambanan in the 8th and 9th centuries and the new powerful Mataram kingdom of the 16th and 17th century.
                Yogyakarta was known with the slogan of “Jogja The Never ending Asia“ for its endless appeals. Today, it is also renowned as “ Jogja Istimewa “, a tagline that elaborates its special values.
                <br><br>
                This city is one of the foremost cultural centers of Indonesia. From strolling through the living museum of The Kraton or The Keraton (Sultan’s Palace), to hanging out at the famous Alun Alun, to watching silversmiths produce amazing jewelry at Kotagede and maybe try a splurge shopping up at Malioboro road.
                Chasing sunrise in famous temples like Prambanan and Borobudur in the neighboring town of Magelang, are only some of the many more ways to never get bored in this relatively small yet bustling city.
